# Sperb - THE Complete Front End WordPress Package

Stripped down to it's bare bones, Sperb is a CSS framework based off of flexbox, but we don't just stop there. 

Sperb is a fully functional, developer-ready front end package for Custom WordPress themes development.

How much time do you waste every time you sit down to get a new project started each time? Whether you're starting from scratch and re-setting up your theme directory the way you like it, or copying over an old project and stripping it down to the basics so you can customize it for another theme/client, you're wasting time. 

Sperb completely eliminates the need for you to waste time at the beginning of your projects, and allows you to start developing IMMEDIATELY. 

**Note:** Sperb's blank WordPress theme is 100% ADA compliant according to W.C.A.G v2.0. While compliance is not yet legally required, it is a nice thing to have as it helps your website's visitors with disabilities navigate around your website with ease and allows screen readers to

## Getting Started

Starting a new project? Perfect. 

Create a new directory in your desired location and run the following:

```
npm install sperb
'''

The above command will NOT ONLY install sperb into your project, but it will install WordPress and do a bunch of other things...

- Install the inner workings of your custom theme.
- Check to see if gulp is installed; if it is not, it will install it for you.
- Install a Sass linter (sass-lint).
- Install a JS linter (jshint).
- Install an image minifier.
- Install an auto-prefixer.
- Installs specific WordPress plugins for security purposes (All in One WP Security)

**Note:** Expect this command to take some time to run. As you can see, there's a lot of stuff going on, so you just need to let it take it's time. I promise it won't take THAT long, and it will still save you time! In fact, once you kick it off, go grab a cup of coffee. By the time you get back, it will be done!

### Prerequisites

Obviously you'll need Node.js to get this running, and a local PHP server like WAMP or MAMP to get your WordPress project running, but other than that...NOTHING. Sperb checks for everything that you need and installs it for you if you don't already have it.
